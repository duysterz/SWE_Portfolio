            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
            I'm relatively new to the field of Software Engineering,
            but I've been actively enhancing my skills through 
            various online bootcamps and courses. 
            These educational experiences have provided me with a 
            solid foundation in coding, problem-solving, and 
            software development practices.

          My interest has particularly gravitated towards Front-End 
          Development. I enjoy the creative aspect of building user 
          interfaces and the immediate impact it has on the user 
          experience. The blend of design and technology in front-end
          work excites me, and I'm keen on diving deeper into this 
          area.
          </p>
          <p>
          In addition to front-end, I've also developed a strong 
          interest in Data Analysis. The ability to make data-driven 
          decisions and uncover insights from raw data fascinates me. 
          I'm eager to explore the intersection of data analysis and 
          software development as I continue my journey in tech.
